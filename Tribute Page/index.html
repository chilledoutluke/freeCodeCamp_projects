				"Ken Kutaragi was an engineer at Sony when he created the PlayStation video-game console and pushed the company to build it. Once dismissed by Sony executives as a mere toy, PlayStation became Sony's cash cow, contributing 60 percent of the company's operating profits in 2003. Kutaragi was rewarded for PlayStation's success with the presidency of Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) and a seat on Sony's corporate board. A business visionary who combined technical and marketing expertise, he was described as brash and outspoken and was considered a maverick among more traditional Japanese executives. As of 2004 he was widely regarded as a potential successor to the Sony Chairman Nobuyuki Idei."
